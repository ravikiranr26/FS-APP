How do we position ourselves with firms like ROC-Connect providing cloud based IoT platform for Insurers?"

Today we hear in the news that the R3-led blockchain consortium of the world’s biggest banks has completed their second known proof of concept experiment of blockchain technology with trials spanning five different blockchain solutions. Forty of the world’s biggest banks that are partners in the private blockchain consortium led by New York-based blockchain-tech startup R3 have tested distributed ledger systems from five blockchain vendors as well as three cloud providers. Keen to add this as a priority into our plan to explore this technology further and understand specifics of POCs being attempted by our clients."

        "text": "Ecosystems: Most commonly used term in the recent times. Undoubtedly there is a realisation that in the new world we need to build ecosystems. But how? …Few options to consider: a. Industry ecosystems – where a trend is embraced by various industry partnerships e.g. Home Energy Management ecosystems are being formed which will have energy companies, telcos, Insurance providers and SI partners. I would refer to it as ‘non-traditional FS’ partnerships  b. Solution partners ecosystem:  i.      Traditional partners with disruptive solutions e.g. IBM BlueMix ii.      Born in the cloud partner ecosystems e.g. Salesforce and AppXchange product partners  iii.      Start-ups (Fintechs)   iv.      Combination of the above  Challenge for us is to figure out how we build new ecosystems that will generate profitable business at the same time does not dilute our own value propositions. Over time we shall build (or identify) integrated solutions with these ecosystem of partners, whereby ‘collectively’ we have better offerings. Additional challenge is to look at alliance management function, it might be based on integrated solutions or a domain area than just individual product partnerships?"

This is an area where I see a good opportunity for SI’s like us. An integral part of Digital transformation is to make end to end IT landscape work and not just the front end or new technology solution. This means we would need Bi-Model IT operating model, support model, SLAs, APIs, services architecture and delivery methods (Agile+legacy) to work.  Will further explore with the teams on what we already have in this space to build on…."

        "text": "Role of Universities/Schools in our business:  “What can you tell us which we don’t know already”, common question we face from our clients (especially tier-1).  We look out for the moments where we can ‘wow’ them. In reality it’s becoming difficult. Given public access to information and many a times we feel clients are ahead or at least pretend to be ahead in the game.  One of the channels to explore is “Universities”. I have seen a huge shift in Universities in researching and developing some of the most advanced topics. In the past our interactions were mostly limited to hiring or a specific joint research…Is there anything more we can do, primarily from a Financial Services standpoint? A few thoughts:  a.       Sharing research topics of interests  b.      Participating in advisory boards and co-located trainings  c.       Partnerships on POCs, POVs  d.      Resource sharing and talent acquisition, through brand building. E.g. guest lectures etc.   e.      Inviting them in our key clients, advisors and internal events I would use CTO community to sign up to key advisory boards and look out for a network of Universities and research institutes to help us drive this future thinking? Another trend associated to Universities is closely working with senior schools and under grads. I would recall a presentation from high school principal and students in our lab who demonstrated some fascinating prototypes developed by students. Potential for us to learn from Gen Y on a regular basis?"

        "text": "There is increasing pressure on our clients to ‘partner’ with regulators than seeing them as obstacles in the Fintech world and in the interest of consumers.  We should have a mechanism to understand regulations at all levels on an ongoing basis and host / facilitate forums to bring in clients and Fintechs to interact with regulators.  This might be geo specific but gives us an upper hand to have meaningful conversation on this subject in the areas of data privacy, cloud and at least understand challenges and how regulators are preparing for the future.  Particularly deep dive conversation on data security and privacy when we discuss cloud, APIs and CRM areas."

        "text": "A week before we spoke about “Platforms” a term quite often carries different meaning for different people. It was amazing to see readiness of our own “Digital Delivery Platform”, which we have been referring as ADC’s (time to find a new name!). Ashish and team did a walkthrough of how ADC’s can provide a jump-start for digital programs with ready to use pre-built set of tools and technologies. Key differentiator is that the ADC will bring in people dimension and not just technology, so we have day-1 productivity assured. Something we should expand to existing ODCs, and at key onsite locations. Thanks Pitchai for the workshop on both RPA and ADCs."
